## Relevance for Roda

As a company in the mobility and gig economy sector, understanding the city's cycling infrastructure is crucial. This dataset can be used to:

*   **Improve route planning:** By incorporating bike lanes into routing algorithms, Roda can provide more efficient and safer routes for its users (e.g., delivery drivers on bikes).
*   **Analyze urban mobility:** The data can be used to analyze the evolution of the bike lane network and its impact on urban mobility.
*   **Develop new products or services:** Roda could develop features like "bike-friendly" route recommendations or safety scores for different areas based on the presence and quality of bike lanes.
